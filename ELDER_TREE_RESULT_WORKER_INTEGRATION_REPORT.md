## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Elder Tree Integration Flow
```
Result Message → Elder Guidance Processing → Slack Notification
     ↓                     ↓                       ↓
Knowledge Sage ←→ Incident Sage ←→ RAG Sage ←→ Elder Council
     ↓                     ↓                       ↓
Elder Tree Hierarchy ←→ Four Sages ←→ Elder Council Summoner
```

### Elder Hierarchy Integration
```
Grand Elder maru
    ↓
Claude Elder (Development Executive)
    ↓
Four Sages (Knowledge, Task, Incident, RAG)
    ↓
Elder Council (5 Council Members)
    ↓
Elder Servants (Result Worker)
```
