## Commands WITHOUT Dedicated Test Files

Based on the file listings, the following commands appear to lack dedicated test files:

### Recently Added Commands
- ❌ `ai_elder_proactive.py`
- ❌ `ai_grand_elder.py`
- ❌ `ai_evolve_daily.py`

### Legacy/Deprecated Commands
These may be covered by integration tests or may be deprecated.

## Test Infrastructure

### Coverage Configuration (`.coveragerc`)
```ini
[run]
source = .
omit =
    */tests/*
    */test_*
    */__pycache__/*
    */venv/*
    */env/*

[report]
exclude_lines =
    pragma: no cover
    def __repr__
    if self.debug:
    raise AssertionError
    raise NotImplementedError

[html]
directory = htmlcov
title = Elders Guild Test Coverage Report
```

### Pytest Configuration (`pytest.ini`)
```ini
[tool:pytest]
testpaths = tests
python_files = test_*.py
addopts =
    --strict-markers
    --tb=short
    --maxfail=100
    -v

markers =
    unit: marks tests as unit tests
    integration: marks tests as integration tests
    asyncio: marks tests as async
    slow: marks tests as slow
```

## Recommendations

### 1. Immediate Actions
- Add tests for the 3 commands without coverage
- Focus on high-impact commands that are frequently used
- Ensure all new commands follow TDD practices

### 2. Test Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Focus on individual command logic
- **Integration Tests**: Test command interactions with workers
- **E2E Tests**: Test complete workflows

### 3. Coverage Goals
- Maintain minimum 60% coverage (currently at 66.7%)
- Aim for 80%+ coverage on critical commands
- 100% coverage on new features (TDD requirement)

### 4. Testing Best Practices
- Follow the existing test patterns (standard, minimal, comprehensive)
- Use mocking for external dependencies (RabbitMQ, Redis, Slack)
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Test error handling and edge cases

## Conclusion

The Elders Guild commands have excellent test coverage overall, with most commands having multiple test variants. The project follows strong testing practices with clear patterns and comprehensive coverage. Only a few recently added commands lack dedicated tests, which should be addressed to maintain the high testing standards.

The current 66.7% overall coverage exceeds the 60% target, demonstrating a strong commitment to code quality and reliability.
