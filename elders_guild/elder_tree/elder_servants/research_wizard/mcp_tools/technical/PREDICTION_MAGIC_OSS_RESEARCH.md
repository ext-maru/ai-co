- Monte Carlo simulations: numpy + custom logic
- Confidence intervals: statsmodels + prophet

### 3. **Capacity Planning Module**
- Linear/polynomial regression: scikit-learn
- Growth curves: scipy.optimize
- Seasonal decomposition: statsmodels

### 4. **Anomaly Detection Module**
- Primary: PyOD with multiple algorithms
- Secondary: scikit-learn Isolation Forest
- Statistical: Z-score, MAD using scipy

## Performance Considerations

Based on 2024 benchmarks:
- **Fastest**: statsmodels (4x faster than competitors for ARIMA)
- **Most Robust**: Prophet (handles missing data, outliers)
- **Most Algorithms**: PyOD (45+ methods)
- **Best Integration**: scikit-learn (universal compatibility)

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Version Pinning**: Lock major versions to ensure stability
2. **Fallback Strategies**: Multiple algorithms for each prediction type
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Track prediction accuracy and speed
4. **Model Selection**: Use cross-validation and automated selection

## Compliance & Licensing

All selected libraries use permissive licenses (BSD, MIT) suitable for both open-source and commercial use, aligning with Elder Guild OSS-First policy.

## Recommendation

Implement Prediction Magic using this multi-library approach:
- Use **statsmodels** and **Prophet** for time series forecasting
- Use **scikit-learn** for general regression and basic anomaly detection
- Use **PyOD** for advanced anomaly detection
- Use **scipy** for statistical calculations and risk assessment

This provides a robust, production-tested foundation while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements.
