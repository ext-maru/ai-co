## ü§ù PM Integration Strategy

### Seamless Coordination
- **Real-time Priority Sharing**: Knights adapt patrol focus based on PM priorities
- **Resource Optimization**: Dynamic allocation based on PM resource status
- **Integrated Reporting**: Knight activities flow into PM project status
- **Preventive Scheduling**: Maintenance aligned with PM-planned windows

### Notification Protocol
- **CRITICAL**: Immediate PM notification, task interruption proposal
- **HIGH**: Next sprint planning integration
- **MEDIUM**: Backlog addition
- **LOW**: Weekly report inclusion

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 4 Sages System Analysis

### Consensus Overview
- **Consensus Confidence**: 85%
- **Collective Recommendation**: "Summon Elder Council for strategic guidance"

### Individual Sage Assessments
- **Knowledge Sage**: Historical patterns suggest immediate attention (90% confidence)
- **Task Sage**: Resource allocation optimization needed (80% confidence)
- **Incident Sage**: Proactive intervention prevents escalation (85% confidence, CRITICAL priority)
- **RAG Sage**: Analysis indicates systematic intervention needed (88% confidence)

## üìù Elder Council Agenda

### Strategic Decisions Required
1. **System Architecture Approval**
   - Review knight squad specializations
   - Approve autonomous operation boundaries
   - Define escalation hierarchies

2. **Resource Authorization**
   - Approve technical resource allocation (4 cores, 4GB RAM, 100GB storage)
   - Authorize development timeline (6 weeks, 3 phases)
   - Confirm PM integration protocol

3. **Authority Framework**
   - Define knight auto-correction permissions
   - Establish human oversight requirements
   - Set escalation triggers and policies

4. **Success Metrics**
   - Approve KPI targets and measurement framework
   - Define rollback criteria and safety measures
   - Establish progress review schedule

5. **Integration Protocols**
   - Approve seamless PM coordination mechanisms
   - Define 4 Sages collaboration framework
   - Establish knowledge sharing protocols

## üîç Risk Assessment

### Risk Level: HIGH
**Justification**: Extremely low test coverage (1.8%) poses significant quality risks, requiring immediate systematic intervention.

### Mitigation Strategies
