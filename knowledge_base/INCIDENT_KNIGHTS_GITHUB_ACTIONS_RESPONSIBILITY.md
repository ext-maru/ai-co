# Incident Knights GitHub Actions Responsibility Framework

## Executive Summary

This document establishes GitHub Actions monitoring and resolution as a core responsibility of the Incident Knights framework. All knights are hereby mandated to provide continuous CI/CD pipeline monitoring, automated issue resolution, and comprehensive reporting for all GitHub Actions workflows.

## Core Mandate

The Incident Knights shall maintain perpetual vigilance over all GitHub Actions workflows, ensuring the continuous integration and deployment pipeline remains operational, efficient, and secure at all times.

## Primary Responsibilities

### 1. Continuous Monitoring

#### 1.1 Real-Time Workflow Monitoring
- **MANDATORY**: Monitor every push, pull request, and scheduled workflow execution
- **RESPONSE TIME**: Immediate detection within 5 seconds of workflow initiation
- **COVERAGE**: 100% of all GitHub Actions across all repositories
- **PERSISTENCE**: Knights must remain active until all workflows complete successfully

#### 1.2 Monitoring Scope
- Build processes
- Test suites (unit, integration, e2e)
- Security scans and vulnerability checks
- Code quality and linting checks
- Deployment pipelines
- Scheduled maintenance workflows
- Custom workflow steps

### 2. Automatic Detection and Classification

#### 2.1 Failure Classification Matrix
Knights must categorize failures according to the following taxonomy:

**Category A - Critical Infrastructure Failures**
- Runner availability issues
- Network connectivity problems
- Authentication/permission failures
- Resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, disk)

**Category B - Code Quality Failures**
- Test suite failures
- Linting violations
- Code coverage drops
- Static analysis warnings

**Category C - Security Failures**
- Vulnerability scan alerts
- Dependency security issues
- Secret exposure risks
- SAST/DAST findings

**Category D - Build and Deployment Failures**
- Compilation errors
- Dependency resolution issues
- Docker build failures
- Deployment configuration errors

#### 2.2 Severity Assessment
Each failure must be assigned a severity level:
- **P0**: Complete pipeline blockage affecting production
- **P1**: Critical failures affecting main branch
- **P2**: Feature branch failures with cascading impact
- **P3**: Isolated failures with minimal impact

### 3. Self-Healing Protocols

#### 3.1 Automated Resolution Strategies

**For Category A Failures:**
1. Retry workflow with exponential backoff (max 3 attempts)
2. Switch to alternative runner pools if available
3. Clear runner caches and restart
4. Implement temporary workarounds for known issues

**For Category B Failures:**
1. Auto-fix linting issues where possible
2. Generate fix PRs for simple test failures
3. Update snapshots for UI tests
4. Adjust test timeouts for flaky tests
5. Quarantine consistently failing tests pending review

**For Category C Failures:**
1. Auto-update dependencies with known fixes
2. Apply security patches
3. Rotate compromised credentials
4. Implement temporary mitigations

**For Category D Failures:**
1. Clear build caches
2. Update dependency lock files
3. Rollback problematic dependency updates
4. Adjust resource allocations
5. Fix common configuration errors

#### 3.2 Resolution Decision Tree
```
1. Detect Failure
   ├─> Classify Category and Severity
   ├─> Check Known Issues Database
   │   ├─> Known Issue Found
   │   │   └─> Apply Documented Fix
   │   └─> Unknown Issue
   │       └─> Proceed to Self-Healing
   ├─> Attempt Self-Healing (Max 3 iterations)
   │   ├─> Success
   │   │   └─> Document Solution
   │   └─> Failure
   │       └─> Escalate to Elder Council
   └─> Generate Report
```

### 4. Escalation Protocols

#### 4.1 Escalation Criteria
Knights SHALL NOT escalate to the Elder Council unless:
- All automated resolution attempts have failed
- The issue affects P0 or P1 severity items
- Manual intervention is explicitly required
- Security implications require human review
- Financial impact exceeds defined thresholds

#### 4.2 Escalation Package Requirements
When escalation is necessary, knights must provide:
- Complete failure timeline and logs
- All attempted resolution strategies
- Root cause analysis
- Recommended manual interventions
- Impact assessment
- Rollback strategies if applicable

### 5. Success Metrics and Reporting

#### 5.1 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

**Operational Metrics:**
- Mean Time to Detection (MTTD): Target < 10 seconds
- Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR): Target < 5 minutes
- Self-Healing Success Rate: Target > 85%
- False Positive Rate: Target < 5%
- Escalation Rate: Target < 10%

**Quality Metrics:**
- Pipeline Success Rate: Target > 95%
- Flaky Test Reduction: Target 50% QoQ
- Security Vulnerability Resolution Time: Target < 24 hours
- Build Time Optimization: Target 10% improvement monthly

#### 5.2 Real-Time Status Updates
Knights must provide:
- Live dashboard of all workflow statuses
- Instant notifications for failures
- Progress updates on resolution attempts
- Success confirmations
- Trend analysis and predictions

#### 5.3 Comprehensive Reporting

**Immediate Reports (Per Incident):**
```yaml
incident_report:
  id: <unique_identifier>
  timestamp: <ISO_8601>
  workflow:
    repository: <repo_name>
    workflow_name: <workflow_file>
    run_id: <github_run_id>
    trigger: <push|pull_request|schedule|manual>
  failure:
    category: <A|B|C|D>
    severity: <P0|P1|P2|P3>
    error_message: <detailed_error>
    affected_jobs: [<job_names>]
  resolution:
    attempts: <number>
    strategies_tried: [<strategy_list>]
    outcome: <success|escalated>
    time_to_resolve: <seconds>
    changes_made: [<change_descriptions>]
  impact:
    blocked_prs: <count>
    affected_developers: <count>
    deployment_delay: <minutes>
```

**Daily Summary Reports:**
- Total workflows monitored
- Success/failure rates by repository
- Top failure causes
- Self-healing effectiveness
- Resource utilization
- Cost optimization opportunities

**Weekly Analysis Reports:**
- Trend analysis
- Pattern recognition insights
- Preventive recommendations
- Infrastructure optimization suggestions
- Process improvement proposals

### 6. Implementation Guidelines

#### 6.1 Knight Activation Rules
- **Automatic Activation**: On every git push or PR creation
- **Persistent Monitoring**: Until all checks pass or escalation occurs
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple knights for concurrent workflows
- **Resource Allocation**: Dynamic scaling based on workload

#### 6.2 Integration Requirements
Knights must integrate with:
- GitHub Actions API
- Repository webhooks
- Notification systems (Slack, email, PagerDuty)
- Monitoring dashboards
- Incident management systems
- Knowledge base for known issues

#### 6.3 Security Considerations
- All knight actions must be audited
- Credentials must be managed via secure vaults
- Write permissions limited to necessary operations
- All fixes must maintain security standards

### 7. Continuous Improvement

#### 7.1 Learning and Adaptation
- Knights must maintain a knowledge base of resolved issues
- Pattern recognition for recurring problems
- Predictive failure analysis
- Optimization of resolution strategies

#### 7.2 Feedback Loop
- Developer satisfaction surveys
- Resolution effectiveness reviews
- Performance metric analysis
- Cost-benefit assessments

## Enforcement and Compliance

This framework is effective immediately upon publication. All Incident Knights must:
1. Acknowledge receipt and understanding
2. Complete certification on GitHub Actions monitoring
3. Demonstrate proficiency in self-healing protocols
4. Maintain minimum performance standards

Non-compliance will result in:
- Immediate retraining
- Performance improvement plans
- Potential decommissioning for persistent failures
