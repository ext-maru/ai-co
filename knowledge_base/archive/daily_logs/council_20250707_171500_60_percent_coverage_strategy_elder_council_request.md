# 🏛️ Elder Council Strategic Session - 60% Coverage Achievement Mission

## 🎯 Mission Summary
**Great Victory Achieved**: 2.3% → 26.5% coverage (1,152% improvement)
**Next Target**: 60% coverage achievement (+33.5% required)

## 🧙‍♂️ Four Sages Assessment

### 📚 Knowledge Sage Analysis
- **Current State**: 364 Python files, 97 test files (26.6% coverage)
- **High-Quality Modules**: predictive_evolution.py (97%), knowledge_evolution.py (89%)
- **Critical Gap**: libs/ module (15.0% coverage, 233 files)
- **Strategic Insight**: Focus on libs/ module will yield maximum coverage gain

### 📋 Task Oracle Priority Matrix
1. **CRITICAL (33.5% gain potential)**: libs/ module comprehensive testing
2. **HIGH (8.5% gain potential)**: commands/ module enhancement
3. **MEDIUM (2.0% gain potential)**: core/ module completion
4. **LOW (maintenance)**: Maintain existing high-coverage modules

### 🚨 Crisis Sage Warning
- **Blocking Issue**: WorkerHealthMonitor get_system_status error persists
- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM - May impact overall system stability
- **Recommended Action**: Immediate fix required before coverage expansion

### 🔍 RAG Sage Intelligence
- **Pattern Discovery**: High-coverage modules show excellent test quality
- **Best Practices**: TDD implementation is proven effective
- **Resource Allocation**: Focus on untested high-impact modules

### Phase 2: Libs Module Assault (Days 3-10)
- **Priority**: Target libs/ module (233 files, 15% coverage)
- **Target**: Achieve 50% coverage in libs/
- **Expected Gain**: +20% overall coverage
- **Resources**: All Elder Servants coordinated effort

### Phase 3: Commands Module Campaign (Days 11-15)
- **Priority**: Enhance commands/ module (65 files, 23% coverage)
- **Target**: Achieve 70% coverage in commands/
- **Expected Gain**: +10% overall coverage
- **Resources**: Knight Brigade + Wizard Council

### Phase 4: Final Core Push (Days 16-20)
- **Priority**: Complete core/ module (30 files, 43% coverage)
- **Target**: Achieve 90% coverage in core/
- **Expected Gain**: +3.5% overall coverage
- **Resources**: Dwarf Workshop + Elf Forest

## 🎯 Victory Conditions

### 60% Coverage Achievement Metrics
- **Primary**: Overall coverage reaches 60%
- **Secondary**: No module below 40% coverage
- **Tertiary**: Maintain 100% test success rate
- **Quality**: All new tests achieve 95%+ individual coverage

### Elder Servant Performance Expectations
