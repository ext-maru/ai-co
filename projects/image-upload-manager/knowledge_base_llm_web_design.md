## Current Best Practices for LLM-driven Web Design {#current-best-practices}

### Core Prompt Engineering Principles

#### 1. **CO-STAR Framework**
A structured approach to prompt design with six components:
- **C**: Context - Provide background information
- **O**: Objective - Define the task clearly
- **S**: Style - Specify writing style
- **T**: Tone - Set attitude and tone of response
- **A**: Audience - Define target audience
- **R**: Response format - Specify expected output format

#### 2. **Precision and Clarity**
- Your prompt must be designed to be **precise, simple, and specific**
- The more succinct and precise, the better the response
- Avoid ambiguity and focus on providing clear instructions and context
- Quality of prompt directly influences relevance, accuracy, and coherence

#### 3. **Self-Evaluation and Quality Control**
```prompt
After generating the design/code, rate your solution on a scale of 1-10 for:
- Accessibility compliance
- Responsive design
- Code quality
- User experience
If the score is below 9, iterate and improve before finalizing.
```

#### 4. **Co-Construction Strategy**
Rather than crafting the perfect prompt initially:
1. Start with a rough outline
2. Ask the LLM to refine the ideal prompt for itself
3. Provide additional context iteratively
4. This allows for fast production of precise and effective prompts

### Design System Integration

#### 1. **Component-Based Approach**
- Break down designs into reusable components
- Maintain consistency across the application
- Use design tokens for scalability

#### 2. **Accessibility-First Design**
- Include WCAG compliance in every prompt
- Specify keyboard navigation requirements
- Request ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- Test with screen readers

#### 3. **Responsive Design Considerations**
- Mobile-first approach is essential
- Specify breakpoints explicitly
- Request fluid grid systems
- Include touch-friendly interactions

## Specific Techniques and Patterns {#specific-techniques-and-patterns}

### Effective Layout Description Techniques

#### 1. **Hierarchical Description**
```prompt
Create a landing page with the following structure:
- Header: Fixed navigation with logo left, menu items center, CTA button right
- Hero Section: Full-width with background image, centered headline, subtext, and two CTAs
- Features Grid: 3 columns on desktop, stacked on mobile, icon + heading + description
- Footer: 4-column layout with links, social icons, and newsletter signup
```

#### 2. **Visual Reference Approach**
```prompt
Design a dashboard similar to Stripe's analytics page with:
- Left sidebar navigation (collapsible)
- Main content area with metric cards
- Data visualization components
- Responsive table with sorting capabilities
```

#### 3. **Component Specification**
```prompt
Create a product card component with:
- Image container (16:9 aspect ratio)
- Product title (max 2 lines, ellipsis overflow)
- Price display with currency
- Add to cart button (primary style)
- Wishlist icon (top-right corner)
- Hover state: slight elevation and image zoom
```

### Accessibility Patterns

#### 1. **ARIA Implementation**
```prompt
Implement an accessible modal dialog with:
- Proper ARIA roles and labels
- Focus trap when open
- Escape key to close
- Return focus to trigger element on close
- Screen reader announcements
```

#### 2. **Keyboard Navigation**
```prompt
Create a navigation menu that supports:
- Tab navigation through items
- Arrow keys for dropdown navigation
- Enter/Space to activate items
- Escape to close dropdowns
- Visual focus indicators
```

### State Management Patterns

#### 1. **Interactive Components**
```prompt
Build a multi-step form wizard with:
- Progress indicator
- Form validation on each step
- Back/Next navigation
- Save progress functionality
- Success/error states
- Loading states during submission
```

#### 2. **Component Evolution**
```
Static Component → Props Integration → State Management → Testing
```

#### 3. **Feedback Loop**
